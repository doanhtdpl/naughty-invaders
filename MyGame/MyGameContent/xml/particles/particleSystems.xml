<!--
  name: to identify each particle system
  texturePath: the path of the texture relative to content/xml/particles/
  type
    - burst: if we want that the nParticles spawn at the same time
    - fountain: if we want that the nParticles spawn at particlesLife/nParticles ratio
  nParticles: number of simultaneous particles the system has
  systemLife: time in seconds of the system
  position: position of the whole system (will be added as an offset to each particle to the position of the system)
  positionVarianceMin/Max: to add a random offset in position for each particle
  direction: direction of the whole system
  directionVarianceMin/Max: same as position variances
  acceleration: acceleration of the whole system
  accelerationVarianceMin/Max: same as position variances
  color: color of the particles
  particlesRotation: initial rotation of each particle
  particlesRotationVariance: angle added to the base rotation of each particle. The angle is a random between - + specified value
  particlesRotationSpeed: speed of rotation of particles
  particlesRotationSpeedVariance: speed added to each particle. The speed is a random between - + specified value
  size: size in meters
  sizeIni: initial size
  sizeEnd: ending size
  fadeIn: time in which the particle alpha and size (from sizeIni to size) will be increasing
  fadeOut: time in which the particle alpha and size (from size to sizeEnd) will be decreasing 
  particlesLife: life of each particle in seconds
